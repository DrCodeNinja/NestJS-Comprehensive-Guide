## What is NestJS?

NestJS is a Node.js framework built with TypeScript, combining elements from both OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming). Its architecture is heavily inspired by Angular, and it uses TypeScript as its primary language, making it ideal for developers who are familiar with Angular or who want to write more maintainable and scalable server-side applications.

## Features

- **TypeScript Support:** Full TypeScript support out of the box.
- **Modular Architecture:** Organize your application into modules, making it easy to scale.
- **Dependency Injection:** Powerful DI system that improves code reusability and testing.
- **Middleware, Guards, Interceptors:** Built-in features for handling cross-cutting concerns.
- **Extensive Ecosystem:** Integrations with popular databases, microservices, WebSockets, GraphQL, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before installing NestJS, make sure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js:** NestJS requires Node.js 10.x or higher.
- **npm or Yarn:** A package manager like npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn is required to install dependencies.

## Installation

### Installing NestJS CLI

The NestJS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that helps you start a project, generate files, and manage your NestJS application.

1. **Install the NestJS CLI globally:**

    ```bash
    npm install -g @nestjs/cli
    ```

    Alternatively, if you're using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn global add @nestjs/cli
    ```

2. **Verify the installation:**

    After installation, you can verify that the NestJS CLI is installed by running:

    ```bash
    nest --version
    ```

### Creating a New Project

1. **Create a new NestJS project using the CLI:**

    ```bash
    nest new project-name
    ```

    Replace `project-name` with the name of your project. The CLI will prompt you to choose a package manager (npm or Yarn). Choose the one you prefer.

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd project-name
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    If you didnâ€™t install dependencies during project creation, you can install them now by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or with Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the application in development mode:**

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    or with Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

2. **Run the application in watch mode:**

    This will restart the application whenever a file changes:

    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```

    or with Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn start:dev
    ```

3. **Open your browser and navigate to:**

    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

    You should see a "Hello World!" message indicating that your NestJS application is up and running.

Thank you..
